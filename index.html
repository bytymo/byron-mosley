                    <h2>Who I am</h2>

                    <p>
                        Creativity has always defined who I am, in one way or another. Whether it be writing the next short story, sketching in my artbook, learning how to play the guitar or discovering new music; creativity and art have continued to be a part of my life. And yet, for years I spent my time pursuing career fields that never allowed for such expression. First the psychology route, then the hospitality industry, followed by the medical field. To me, creativity didn't make it in the real world.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        And then in 2018 when I was working in the medical field on a waitlist to work in the operating room, I began looking for ways to make some side income. Web development seemed to be a very popular suggestion among all of the articles and YouTube videos. I thought if it was so suggested, there must be something to it, something I never knew about if it was so widely sought out. And that was the start of the next chapter in my life. I love the balance of consistency and evolution in coding; how similar yet entirely different each language is to the next. And how creative you can be with the design and implementation of the code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I joined Thinkful's prep course in October of 2020 and will be joining the December or January start date to continue my software developer journey. I am excited to have direction, mentorship, and all of the resources I need to shape myself into a better developer; and know that when I graduate from their program, I will have developed the skills and knowledge to be a competent developer.
